= Hands-on Disaster Recovery of OpenShift containers and VMs with Trident protect

This lab provides a comprehensive, hands-on walkthrough demonstrating how to deploy and utilize NetApp Trident Protect to establish a robust Disaster Recovery plan for both Virtual Machines (VMs) and containerized applications across two distinct environments.

The lab is structured to reflect real-world roles:

=== Admin Persona Tasks: 
You will first install and configure the NetApp Trident Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver on the secondary ROSA cluster, provisioning volumes on an FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. Following this, you will install Trident Protect and configure it to store application data and metadata backups in an AWS S3 bucket.

=== User Persona Tasks: 
Once the infrastructure is ready, you will proceed with the core VM Disaster Recovery workflow, learning how to provision, replicate, and fail over a VM running in OpenShift Virtualization to the secondary cluster.

As a bonus section, you can learn the steps necessary to back up, restore, and fail over container-based applications to showcase the full range of Trident Protect capabilities.

=== Here is your agenda:

Introduction & Overview::
  * Trident & Trident Protect Intoduction
  * Lav Environment
  * Accessing the Lab
 
Admin Persona: Configuration::
  * Install and configure Trident on OpenShift DR Cluster
  * Install and configure Trident Protect on OpenShift DR Cluster

User Persona: VM Operations::
  * Provision VMs in OpenShift Virtualization
  * Configure storage replication for VM workloads
  * Perform a Failover for VM workloads

Bonus 1: Advanced VM Features::
  * Restore a Virtual Machine from a snapshot
  * Add a second Virtual Machine to the project and test the failover

Bonus 2: Container Workloads::
  * Provision container workloads
  * Backup/Restore container workloads
  * Configure storage replication for container workloads
  * Perform the Failover and Failback for container workloads
