## Lab Environment

The lab environment consists of the following components:

=== Cluster and Networking Configuration

* **OpenShift Clusters (ROSA):** Two Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters, named *prod* and *dr*, both running OpenShift 4.18.
* **Networking (VPCs):** Each ROSA cluster resides in its own VPC within a single AWS account.
** *prod* VPC CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`
** *dr* VPC CIDR: `10.10.0.0/16`
* **VPC Peering:** A VPC peering connection is configured between both VPCs to allow replication traffic.
* **Security:** Route tables and Security Groups are updated to allow replication traffic in both directions.

=== Storage and Replication

* **Storage:** Each VPC contains an **FSx for NetApp ONTAP** file system.
* **Connectivity:** Security Groups are configured to allow connectivity between the ROSA cluster and its respective FSx file system.
* **Storage Virtual Machine (SVM):** Inside each FSx file system, a dedicated SVM has been created for OpenShift use.
* **Replication:** The replication technology used by Trident Protect is NetApp SnapMirror.
* **SnapMirror** efficiently replicates delta snapshots asynchronously between the SVMs of the two FSx file systems.
* **FSx** file systems and their respective SVMs are already peered to facilitate replication.


=== Deployment Status & Tasks

* **AWS S3 Bucket:** An S3 bucket is already created and used by Trident Protect as the destination for data and metadata backups.
* **Prod Cluster Status:** Trident and Trident Protect are already installed and configured in the *prod* ROSA cluster.

* **Your Deployment Tasks:**
** Deploy and configure Trident in the *dr* ROSA cluster.
** Deploy and configure Trident Protect in the *dr* ROSA cluster.

=== Workload Overview

You will perform the following VM replication:

* **Source:** Provision a **CentOS 9 VM** in the `my-vm` namespace of the *prod* ROSA cluster.
* **Target:** Replicate the VM to the `vmdr` namespace in the *dr* ROSA cluster, as reflected in the following diagram.
