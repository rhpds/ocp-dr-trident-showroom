# Module 3: Provision VM workload

In this chapter, you will perform the following tasks:

* Create a Virtual Machine with the OpenShift Console

== OpenShift context management

At this point, you already logged in both ROSA clusters. +
When using the `oc` tool, you can easily switch between clusters, by using the command `oc config use-context`. +

However, as the context names are pretty long, it is a good practice to rename them with the `oc config rename-context` command to avoid typing errors.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc config rename-context $(oc config get-contexts | grep -E default.*api-prod | cut -c 11- | awk '{print $1}') PROD
oc config rename-context $(oc config get-contexts | grep -E default.*api-dr | cut -c 11- | awk '{print $1}') DR
----

Let's quickly check this was succesfully applied:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc config get-contexts
----
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
CURRENT   NAME   CLUSTER                                         AUTHINFO                                                      NAMESPACE
          DR     api-dr-p4p6h-t9k7-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443     cluster-admin/api-dr-p4p6h-t9k7-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443     default
*         PROD   api-prod-p4p6h-jtx8-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443   cluster-admin/api-prod-p4p6h-jtx8-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443   default
----

You should already be logged into the PROD environment, as indicated by the `*` in the first column of the output. +
In case you need to switch back to it, here is the command to run:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role=execute]

oc config use-context PROD

Time to deploy workloads!

[#deployvm]
== Deploy a simple VM with a Block RWX volume

For this chapter, most tasks are going to be done in the OpenShift GUI.

=== Project creation

* Log into the PROD OpenShift console
** *URL*: {rosa_prod_openshift_console_url}[window=_blank] icon:external-link[]
** *user*: `{rosa_prod_openshift_admin_user}`
** *password*: `{rosa_prod_openshift_admin_password}`

* Navigate to *Home -> Projects* and create a new project by using the *Create Project* button on the top right.
Name the project `my-vm`

=== VM creation

* Navigate to the *VirtualMachines* sub-menu of the *Virtualization* menu (make sure you are on the right project), press *Create Virtual Machine* and then choose *From template*

* Select the *CentOS Stream 9 VM* template.
This will open a new form.

[NOTE]
====
As you can see, the template you are selecting is labelled *Source available*. +
This means that the corresponding image volume exists on this cluster with the default storage class configured for Virtual Machines.
====

* Leave all the default parameters
** including _Disk source = Template default_ (that will use the volume snapshot set during the optimization configuration in the previous module)
** you can optionally change the VM name
* Press `Quick create VirtualMachine`

=== Verify the objects related to that VM with the CLI

Check the status of the VM and its disk/PVC volume.

As you can see, the creation was super fast. +

NOTE: If the Template Image disk was on a different storage class, the process would have taken much longer (about 10 minutes), as it would first need to copy the data into a different volume.
Due to the NetApp ONTAP cloning technology being used in this setup, creation of the VM disk is always fast, independent of the template size.

* You can also see the status of the VM in the Console:

* You are now done with this module.
Please proceed with the next one.
